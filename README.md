# CustomLocalSaves
A mod for Grand Theft Auto V that gives you control over your online saves.
Strictly for educational purposes.

## Features
### User editable json save files
The save files are located at `%appdata%/CLS`.
If you're planning on manually editing your save files you may want to enable
`use_human_readable_stat_names` in `%appdata%/CLS/settings.json`.
With this enabled your save files will use stat strings instead of stat hashes.

### Loading FSL saves
Loads FSL save files if you place them in `%appdata%/CLS`, and enable `load_fsl_files` in `%appdata%/CLS/settings.json`.
Note that FSL saves will only load if json saves were not found.
Saving in an FSL compatible format is NOT yet SUPPORTED.

### Stats that will be set on every load.
You may want certain stats to reset every time you load, for this create `%appdata%/CLS/save_overwrite.json`.
It uses the same syntax as the other save files, but it is never written to.
Here is an example `save_overwrite.json` that will refil your armor every time you load into GTA Online.
```json
{
	"BOOL": [],
	"DATE": [],
	"FLOAT": [],
	"INT": [
		[
			"MP0_MP_CHAR_ARMOUR_1_COUNT",
			10
		],
		[
			"MP0_MP_CHAR_ARMOUR_2_COUNT",
			10
		],
		[
			"MP0_MP_CHAR_ARMOUR_3_COUNT",
			10
		],
		[
			"MP0_MP_CHAR_ARMOUR_4_COUNT",
			10
		],
		[
			"MP0_MP_CHAR_ARMOUR_5_COUNT",
			10
		]
	],
	"INT64": [],
	"PACKED": [],
	"POS": [],
	"STRING": [],
	"TEXTLABEL": [],
	"UINT16": [],
	"UINT32": [],
	"UINT64": [],
	"UINT8": [],
	"USERID": [],
	"uses_human_readable_stat_names": true
}
```

### GTA Online without R* services
CLS can load into GTA Online even if you don't have connection to R* services at the coast of breaking missions,
to enable this set `no_rgs` to `true` in `%appdata%/CLS/settings.json`.

## Usage
1. Install an ASI loader, I tested with [Ultimate-ASI-Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) as `bink2w64.dll`.
2. Put CLS.asi into your game directory, or wherever your asi loader will load from.
3. Run the game with a mod that has an anti-cheat bypass or use goldberg emulator.

## Building

### Windows
To build BigBaseV2 you need:

* Visual Studio 2019 or higher
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download)

To set up the build environment, run the following commands in a terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TupoyeMenu/CustomLocalSaves.git
cd CustomLocalSaves
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Now, you will be able to open the solution, and simply build it in Visual Studio.

### GNU/Linux
To build BigBaseV2 you need:

* MinGW 13 or higher
* CMake
* Ninja? Didn't test make.

To set up the build environment, run the following commands in a terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TupoyeMenu/CustomLocalSaves.git
cd CustomLocalSaves
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCROSSCOMPILE=ON -DUSE_GCC=ON -G Ninja
ninja
```
